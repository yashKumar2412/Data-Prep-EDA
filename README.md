# Data-Prep-EDA
As part of my Data Mining coursework, I have created this assignment repository to display my work on Data Prep and EDA phases of Data Mining using AutoML libraries.

There are two sections of this project:
1. Tabular data - Applied EDA, Data Viz, Data Prep, and Modelling on [Student Performance Factors dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors). Refer [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1liOvtNSQDxG_woPrNlywuEfptnn50Qgv?usp=sharing).
2. Time Series data - Applied EDA, Data Viz, Data Prep, and Modelling on [Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data?select=GlobalTemperatures.csv). Refer [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gn9Vx8w_DpZULMhdCFIRwQdbyiOEeuSd?usp=drive_link).

I used AutoEDA and AutoViML libraries to implement these steps of the project.
